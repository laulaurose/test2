For using this pipeline: 
First use any of the sleep stage models that can be found in Models. 
Next the features.py script can be used to extract features from EEG and EMG signals based on the sleep scores that is ouputted from the automatic sleep staging algorithm. 
Finally the exp_a.py includes the application and training of the lasso model on a test set.
